    <h1>ABOUT</h1>
    <p>Rebranding <a href="https://especiallyforchildren.com/"target="_blank">Especially for Children</a>, which is an existing childcare organization with multiple locations in the Twin Cities area. Since EFC started in 1976, I believe a visual re-brand would be beneficial to both the teachers and parents at EFC and it would create a stronger brand identity overall. I want to create a simpler, more modernized look that incorporates new tools and systems to improve the EFC environment as a whole.</p>
